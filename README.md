# GameTank Sound Sculptor

A sound effect authoring tool for [GameTank](https://gametank.zone) games. This is based off a similar tool by [Clyde Shaffer](https://github.com/clydeshaffer/) but attempts to improve the editing experience and make it easy to input exact values when desired.

### Running

A dev server can be ran locally with `npm run dev`. This use port `5173` by default.

Alternatively, static files can be produced with `npm run build` and served as you'd like.

### File format

The sound effects are packed in a binary format. The first byte represents sound effect length in frames (60fps).  The second byte represents the level of feedback. From this point on, each frame's sample is stored as 8 bytes: one for each operator's amplitude followed by one for each operator's pitch.

### Previewing SFX

An integrated GameTank emulator is used to facilitate previewing sounds. Due to browser restrictions, it is generally necessary to click on the emulator before it can produce sounds.

The emulator is built from [this repo](https://github.com/clydeshaffer/GameTankEmulator/tree/sfx_preview). It's build products, `emulator.js` and `emulator.wasm` are checked in to this repo in the `public/` directory. A custom ROM, [sfx.gtr](https://github.com/clydeshaffer/GameTankEmulator/blob/sfx_preview/roms/sfx.gtr), is used to play the sounds. Ideally, building the emulator would take place while building this application so that we wouldn't have to check in build artifacts, but for now this is fine.

### Future work

Currently it is not possible to import a previously exported sound effect. This would make it possible to touch up previously made sound effects. Currently if this feature is required, Clyde's sfx tool can be used.
